## 🔍 Overview

This project is a Python-based implementation of face recognition using the Haar Cascade algorithm. It is currently in its initial stages and serves as a foundation for building a more advanced face recognition system. The project comprises the following key components:

- 📸 `generateimages.py`: A script to capture and save images of known individuals for training the recognition model.
- 📦 `createdataandlabel.py`: A script to preprocess the captured images, create labels, and organize the training dataset.
- 🤖 `model.py`: Contains the code for training a face recognition model using the preprocessed data.
- 🧪 `testing.py`: A script to test the trained model on new images and perform face recognition.

## 🚀 Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: OpenCV, Numpy, TensorFlow, tqdm

### 💻 Installation

Follow these steps to install the required libraries for the project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name

2. Install the necessary libraries using `pip`:

- 🖼 **OpenCV**: For image processing.

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

- 🔢 NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.

   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

- 🤖 TensorFlow: For machine learning and deep learning tasks.

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

- 📊 tqdm: For displaying progress bars during time-consuming operations.

   ```bash
   pip install tqdm
   ```

## 📚 Usage

Here's how to use the project for face recognition:

1. Capture images of known individuals using `generateimages.py`. Organize these images into folders with each person's name.

   ```bash
   python generateimages.py
   ```

2. Run `createdataandlabel.py` to preprocess the captured images, create training data, and store them in the data folder.

   ```bash
   python createdataandlabel.py
   ```

3. Train the face recognition model using `model.py`.

   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

4. Test the trained model on new images for face recognition using `testing.py`.

   ```bash
   python testing.py
   ```
